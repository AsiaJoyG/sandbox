/*
   Remove Duplicates

   Hi! Welcome to your first homework assignment. :) You'll be writing a function called removeDuplicates that takes a single parameter, a *sorted* array of numbers
   and returns an array of numbers with all duplicates removed. That is to say, if you receive an array of [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]... the function will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   After that, (or before, if you want) you will write a function called removeDuplicateCharacters that removes duplicate characters in a string.
   (e.g. "aardvaark" returns "ardvark")
   Note that it's probably best to approach this with stringbuilding because strings are *immutable*

   You can test your code by opening your Terminal, navigating to the 'sandbox' directory, and then typing `jest` and hitting ENTER (heretoafter known as 'running jest')
   Jest is a testing framework that we will play with more in the future, but for now, don't worry about it too much. Jest will run two tests, one for each function
   and let you know if they pass or fail.

   Don't forget to run `npm install` first! (also inside the 'sandbox' directory), and remember to Google things when you get stuck!
